# Math Game (Console)

## 📌 Description
A console-based implementation of a Math Game using C++. The project focuses on applying structured programming concepts such as functions, enums, structs, input validation, and multi-file organization.

## 🚀 Features
- Choose difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Mixed)
- Select operation type (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Mixed)
- Choose number of rounds
- Randomly generated math questions
- Instant feedback for each answer
- Displays correct answer when incorrect
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Console color changes based on result:
  - Green → Correct
  - Red → Wrong
  - Yellow → Excellent final score
- Replay option

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Console Application (Windows)

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project using Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Run the application

## 💡 What I Learned
- Using structs to organize related data
- Applying enums for cleaner logic
- Handling user input safely
- Generating random numbers
- Managing game loops efficiently
